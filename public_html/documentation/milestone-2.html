            <h2>Summary</h2>
              <p>The site will consist of six sections in one long page with anchor links around the page, a downloadable
                 image file, a native contact form, and a link that opens in the user's email with a populated subject line
                 "Request Estimate."</p>
            <h2>Mobile Version</h2>
              <p>The mobile version will be as close to the desktop version as possible, with a hamburger menu taking the
                 place of the clickable links of the man menu. The layout will be more narrow and the small fonts that
                 appear on the desktop may be relocated to areas where they can be enlarged and more legible.
              </p>
              <h3>1. Menu Bar/Hamburger Menu</h3>
                <p>The menu/hamburger will be located on the top of the page in the far right corner. There will be three
                  options that include: ABOUT WORK and CONTACT. The hamburger menu will drop down with a translucent
                  background. The anchor links will resolve farther down the page at each named section.</p>
              <h3>2. Landing Page</h3>
                <p>The landing page will have a title "Web Developer & Consultant, Full-stack." There will be an image of me
                  below that on the right with my name below it. There will be a list of my specialities and highlight my
                  years of experience. I will also mention the populations I prioritize. There will be a big red button
                  inviting visitors to request an estimate.
                </p>
              <h3>3. About Section</h3>
                <p>This section lists the experience that qualifies me to develop and consult for organizations, including
                  my positions, my technology proficiencies, and education. There will be a big button to download my
                  resume. I will add testimonials.
                </p>
              <h3>4. Work Section</h3>
                <p>
                  This section will consist of examples of my work with titles and accordion modules that list credits and
                  other details. The media will either be a video, image gallery, or embed. The image file I submitted has
                  three works, but by the end of the bootcamp, I will assess any new projects for suitability for inclusion.
                </p>
              <h3>5. Contact Form</h3>
                <p>A basic contact form with inputs for name, email, subject, and message.
                </p>
              <h3>6. Footer</h3>
                <p>The footer will include my name, title, city, state, country, email, phone number, and linked social
                  media icons.
                </P>
