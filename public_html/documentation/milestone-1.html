            <h3 class="personaDescription">II. User Persona: Janie E.</h3>
            <div class="pro grid">
              <p><strong>USER PROFESSION</strong><br><br>Janie is the Executive Director of <em>Willow River Equine
                Rescue</em>, a mid-sized New Mexico 501(c)3 organization. Although 75% of their funding comes from
                grants and major donors, another 25% is raised from programs and merchandise that include animal
                husbandry classes and logo-ware, respectively. Janie’s non-profit is expanding its reach, and she
                recognizes the need for a professional and user-friendly website. Her current website is outdated,
                difficult to navigate, and does not effectively communicate their mission or accept online donations
                efficiently. Janie is looking for a reliable web developer who can redesign the website, make it easy
                to manage, and provide ongoing support and integration with social media and development campaigns.
              </p>
              <p><strong>USER BEHAVIORS AND ATTITUDES</strong><br><br>Janie is proactive and organized, always
                seeking efficient solutions for her organization. She values clear communication and transparency from
                service providers. Janie has a basic understanding of web technologies but prefers to focus on her core
                 responsibilities in fundraising, outreach, and program management. She often seeks out recommendations
                and reviews online before committing to a service provider.
              </p>
              <p><strong>USER PAIN POINTS</strong><br><br>
                Janie has a limited budget for web development, and on-going security, and maintenance, as well as a
                lack of in-house technical expertise to handle serious website issues. Her current website’s poor user
                experience is deterring potential donors and volunteers. She has had Difficulty finding a communicative
                and trustworthy web developer. The User needs someone who is familiar with the situations of
                social-profit organizations. She needs someone who is highly responsive and genuinely cares about their
                success.

               <p><strong>USER GOALS</strong><br><br>
                 Janie's goals involve finding a web developer who can create a visually appealing, easy-to-navigate
                 website that effectively communicates their purpose and services. She wants to have a CMS that allows
                 easy updates and management by the non-technical staff. She wants to ensure the website is optimized
                 for SEO to increase visibility and improve user data security. This will require establishing a
                 long-term relationship with a competent and reliable developer who can provide ongoing support and
                 updates.
